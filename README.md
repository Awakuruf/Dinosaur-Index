## What is so special about this Index?

Welcome to the **Pangea Dinosaur Index**!!!

Get ready to become a dinosaur master just like Dr.Hammond
(From the infamous Jurassic Park!)

This index includes multiple functions that allows you to filter for the specific dinosaurs you want to know in-depth about!

A list of *functions* you can do with this Index:
- Allows you to search for the specific dinosaur and returns their information!
- Filter the specific time period the specific dinosaur lived in (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.)
- Filter through Dinosaur types to search for variants of specific dinosaurs
- View the family tree of the speicfic dinosaur and it's ancestors! [Coming SOON!]
- Add your newly discovered dinosaur into the index!

Gives you in-depth information about the specific dinosaur in the dino page! Which includes...
- 
- The full name of the dinosaur.
- Short description of what kind of dinosaur it was!
- What family of dinosaur it belongs to. [Coming SOON!]
- Size
- Where they lived in // Location where the fossil was found.
- Diets (Carnivore, Omnivore, Herbivore, Scavenger)
- The era they lived in and how long ago that was.
- What kind of dinosaurs it lived along with.

This index can be used from anyone that are simply interested in dinosaurs that wants to immerse themselves in what earth was like 650 million years ago to paleontologists that are finding new species of dinosaurs, but can't exactly pinpoint whether the finding represented a kind of variant / subspecies or a completely new dinosaur!. 

Ever since I was little, I've always been interested in these mysterious creature that roamed around earth 650 million years ago. I've been to multiple fossil sites. This includes going on a Centrosaurus (Type of dinosaur) fossil expedition with the infamous Drumheller's Royal Tyrrel Musesum expedition crew. With refinement, I believe this index can be used to literally anyone interested in dinosaurs and prehistoric earth!

**What are you waiting for? It's time to go back to the *past!***
